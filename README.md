# README
This is the backend API created for running alongside the frontend repo I created here: https://github.com/wizbeck21/valheim-worldshare-frontend


THINGS TO KNOW:
- Database is ran via PostgreSQL
- make sure postgresql service is up and running before launching rails server.
- This repo supplies the frontend repo above for database interactions and fetch requests to POST and GET request made by the front end repo.

You can view the readme of the frontend portion of the project at the link listed above for more information.
